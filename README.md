# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants solve them in the language of their choice (Python for me).

This repository contains my solutions for each day's challenges, organized by folder.

## Repository Structure

- Each `dayX/` folder corresponds to a specific day's challenge.
- `dayX.py` contains the Python solution for that day's puzzle.
- `dayX.txt` contains the actual puzzle input.
- `dayXTestInput.txt` (if present) contains test input for debugging and testing.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/LeftsideMartian/adventOfCode2024.git`
   `cd adventOfCode2024`

2. Navigate to the folder for the day you want to run:
    
    `cd day1`

3. Run the Python script:
    
    `python day1.py`
